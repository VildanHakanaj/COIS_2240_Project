Agenda
- A scheduling app built to let the user schedule and create events on various dates
- Users first create an account to log in and out of the software
- Logging into the software allows users to view events that are scheduled as well as event details





Prerequisites
- Java Data Base Controller

Installing
- If compiling the source code does not work
- Right click the 'sqlite-jdbc-3.21.0.jar' inside of the "lib" folder
- Select include as library

Getting started
- Open the app and open the create user tab
- Fill out the required information to create a user
  When you are opening the app later you can use this user information to log in
- Select a day you want to view the events for on the calendar pane to open the day pane
- Create a new event by pressing the "New Event" button
- View details about an event by pressing on the event
