## Calendar Scheduler

This is a calendar with an event scheduler. This project was completed for COIS2240 class. 
This project will allow the user to input a certain event they need to remember and the application will ask for the proper information for storing or updating events like time date and place. It will notify the user if they already have a duplicate event and can detect the first available time that the event can go into. It features a ui for the calendar that the user can interact with. It implements drag and drop feature for the events.
